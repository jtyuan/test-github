	``May your first talk be more peaceful.''
}\end{quote}
In this section, we'll leverage the theory of diagram spectra developed over the past two sections in the
equivariant setting, defining the equivariant stable category as the homotopy category of orthogonal $G$-spectra.
In this context, we must talk about universes, making choices of which orbits $G/H$ are dualizable. This is closely
related to choosing representations $V$ such that $G/H\inj V$ equivariantly.
\begin{defn}
A \term{universe} is a countably infinite-dimensional real inner product space with a $G$-action through
isometries. There is some collection $R$ of irreducible representations such that $U$ contains countably many
copies of each irreducible in $R$, and $R$ always has all of the trivial representations.\footnote{Ideally, $U$
should not contain other representations. Sometimes people are vague about this, where there may be other
representations and you ignore them, but it's better to just not have them.}
\end{defn}
Sometimes we'll ask for more structure, such as $R$ being closed under tensor products. The inclusion of the
trivial representation\index{trivial representation} is what makes this a strict generalization of ordinary stable
homotopy theory: for example, if $U = \R^\infty$ with the trivial $G$-action, the homotopy groups are the
nonequivariant homotopy groups.\footnote{More explicitly, this is a stabilization of the category of presheaves on
$BG$. Depending on your definitions, this is more or less a tautology --- stabilization in $\infty$-categories is
defined by taking spectrum objects.} Another common choice of $U$ is a \term{complete universe}, containing all
irreducible representations infinitely often, so all orbits are dualizable.

$G$-prespectra were defined classically in a manner similar to prespectra. They mix point-set and homotopical data,
which is a little odd.
\begin{comp}{defn}{itemize}
	\item A \term[G-prespectrum@$G$-prespectrum]{$G$-prespectrum} $X$ is the data of a $G$-space $X(V)$ for every
	finite-dimensional subspace $V\subset U$ and $G$-maps $S^W\wedge X(V)\to X(V\oplus W)$ for each pair $V$ and
	$W$, such that the structure maps are associative.
	\item A $G$-prespectrum is an \term*{$\Omega$-prespectrum}\index{Omega-prespectrum@$\Omega$-prespectrum!for
	$G$-spectra} if for all $V$ and $W$, the adjoint to the structure map is a homeomorphism: $X(V)\congto\Omega^W
	X(V\oplus W)$.
	\item The \term[homotopy groups!of a $G$-prespectrum]{homotopy groups} of a $G$-prespectrum are
	\begin{align*}
		\pi_q^H(X) &\coloneqq \colim_V \pi_q^H \Omega^V X(V)\\
		\pi_{-q}^H(X) &\coloneqq \colim_{\substack{V\supset\R^m\\m > 0}} \pi_0^H\Omega^{V - \R^m}X(V).
	\end{align*}
	Here $q\ge 0$, $\R^m$ denotes the trivial representation of dimension $m$, which we specified was in $U$, and
	$V - \R^n$ denotes the orthogonal complement.
\end{comp}
\begin{prop}
There is a model structure on $G$-prespectra where the weak equivalences are the stable equivalences (equivalently,
$\pi_*$-isomorphisms).\index{model structure!on $G$-prespectra}
\end{prop}
The proof is identical to the nonequivariant case. One cool aspect of this is that homotopy groups are determined
by trivial representations, and we'll see that for orthogonal $G$-spectra, this is also true at the point-set
level. It's nice to not have to carry around the entire universe, just the trivial representations. We'll use this
philosophy in the proof of \cref{Wirthiso}.
\begin{defn}
The \term{equivariant stable homotopy category} (\term*{structured by $U$}) is the homotopy category of
$G$-prespectra.
\end{defn}
This is the category in which we have Poincaré duality for the orbits $G/H$ that embed in $U$. The functors
$\Sigma^V\coloneqq S^V\wedge\bl$ and $\Omega^V\coloneqq\Map(S^V,\bl)$ are inverse equivalences.\index{Poincaré
duality!equivariant setting}
\begin{rem}
It would be nice to write down some sort of equivariant analogue of a triangulated structure on the equivariant
stable category, but trying to get an $\RO(G)$-grading (i.e.\ shifts by arbitrary representations of $G$) does not
work except in ad hoc ways for $G = C_2$. However, you can keep track of the action of the Picard group
$\operatorname{Pic}(\Spc^G)$ on the equivariant stable category.\index{Picard group}
\end{rem}
\subsection*{Orthogonal $G$-spectra.}
Let's build a point-set model of the equivariant stable category. Let $V$ and $V'$ be finite-dimensional
irreducible $G$-representations (by which we mean finite-dimensional subspaces of $U$), and let $I_G(V,V')$ be the
linear, $G$-equivariant isometries.\footnote{Unlike the nonequivariant case, we're not taking isometric
isomorphisms, so maps in $I_G(V,V')$ must be injective, but may have nontrivial cokernel.}
\begin{defn}
The \term{complement bundle} $E(V,V')$ is the subbundle of the product bundle $I_G(V,V')\times V'$ consisting of
pairs $(f,x)$ such that $x\in V' - f(V)$. Let $\wI_G(V,V')$ denote the Thom space of this bundle.
\end{defn}
We're trying to create spheres: $\wI_G(V,V')$ should topologize $S^{V' - f(V)}$. For example, if $V\subset V'$,
this is isomorphic to $\O(V')\wedge_{\O(V'-V)} S^{V' - V}$.

Let $\wI_G$ denote the category whose objects are finite-dimensional subspaces $V$ of $U$ and whose morphisms are
$\wI_G(V,V')$.
\begin{defn}
An \term{orthogonal $G$-spectrum} is a $\Top$-enriched functor $\wI_G\to G\Top$. The category of orthogonal
$G$-spectra is denoted $\Spc^G$, or $\Spc^G_U$ if the universe needs to be explicit.
\end{defn}
For the nonequivariant case, we defined $\fD$-spaces and spectra to be modules over a certain monoid in them, and
then showed that you could think of them as diagram spaces for a more complicated diagram. Here, we've done this
all at once --- it's simpler to define $\wI_G$ than find a module in a simpler category of diagram spaces.
% see the definition for Mackey functors later
% \begin{exm}[Equivariant Eilenberg-Mac Lane spectra]
% Let $G$ be finite and $M$ be a countable $\Z[G]$-module (equivalently an abelian group with an action of $G$).
% Following \cref{orthogonal_HA}, we can define an \term{equivariant Eilenberg-Mac Lane spectrum} $HM$ to be the
% orthogonal $G$-spectrum that assigns to a representation $V$ the $M$-linearization $HM(V)\coloneqq M[S^V]$.  Here,
% the orthogonal group acts through its action on $S^V$, and $G$ acts on both $M$ and $S^V$ from the right. The
% structure map $S^V\wedge M[S^W]\to M[S^{V\oplus W}]$ is as in~\eqref{orth_HA_structure_map}.
% 
% If $M$ is also a $\Z[G]$-algebra, then $HM$ is an orthogonal $G$-ring spectrum through the multiplication map
% $\mu\colon M[S^V]\wedge M[S^W]\to M[S^{V\oplus W}]$ defined by
% \[\paren{\sum_i m_i\cdot v_i}\wedge\paren*[\Bigg]{\sum_j m_j'\cdot w_j} \mapsto \sum_{i,j} (m_im_j')\cdot
% (v_i\wedge w_j).\]
% This example is discussed further in~\cite[Example 2.13]{SchwedeEquivariant}.
% \end{exm}

There is a forgetful functor $U$ from $\Spc^G$ to the category of $G$-prespectra; we define a map $f$ in $\Spc^G$
to be a \term[pistar-isomorphism@$\pi_*$-isomorphism!of orthogonal $G$-spectra]{$\pi_*$-isomorphism} if $Uf$ is a
$\pi_*$-isomorphism. $\Spc^G$ is symmetric monoidal under Day convolution, just as before.\index{Day convolution}
\begin{thm}
$\Spc^G$ has a stable model structure in which the weak equivalences are $\pi_*$-isomorphisms, the fibrations are
levelwise fibrations, and the generating cofibrations are\index{stable model structure!for orthogonal $G$-spectra}
\[F_V\paren{(G/H\times S^{n-1})_+\longrightarrow (G/H\times D^n)_+}.\]
\end{thm}
Here, $F_V$ is adjoint to evaluation at $V$, as before.

Moreover, the smash product is compatible with the model structure. If $X$ is cofibrant, then $X\wedge Y$ computes
Tor $X\wedge^\LD Y$. Another way to say this is that if $X$ is cofibrant, $X\wedge\bl$ preserves weak equivalences.
The proof is where cofibrantly generated model categories shine: $X\wedge\bl$ is a colimit, so it commutes with
colimits, and cofibrant objects are retracts of cell complexes, so you can reduce to the case where $X$ is a single
cell, which admits a direct proof. Once again the stable homotopy category behaves like homological
algebra.\index{model category!cofibrantly generated}
\begin{exm}
Let $X\in\Spc$. Then, ``letting $G$ act trivially on $X$'' defines a $G$-spectrum also denoted $X$, such that for
any $n$-dimensional $G$-representation $V$, $X(V)$ is, as an $\O_n$-space, equal to $X_n$. However, the $G$-action
on $X(V)$ need not be trivial: $V$ and its $G$-invariant inner product determine a map $G\to O(V)$, and $G$ acts on
$X(V)$ through this map. Since the structure maps respect the $G$-action, this defines an orthogonal $G$-spectrum.

One important example is the \term{equivariant sphere spectrum} $\Sph$: $\Sph(V) = S^V$. It is the unit of
$\Spc^G$.
\end{exm}
\begin{exm}[Suspension spectra]
Let $X$ be a based $G$-space; then, the \term[suspension spectrum!of a $G$-space]{suspension spectrum} of $X$,
denoted $\Sigma^\infty X$, is the $G$-spectrum whose component on a $G$-representation $V$ is
\[\Sigma^\infty X(V)\coloneqq X\wedge S^V.\]
Given an equivariant map $V\to W$, the structure map $\Sigma^\infty X(V)\to\Sigma^\infty X(W)$ is its one-point
compactification smashed with $\id_X$.

In particular, if you give $S^0$ the trivial $G$-action, $\Sigma^\infty S^0\cong\Sph$.
\end{exm}
\begin{exm}[Real $K$-theory]
Real $K$-theory, as discovered by Atiyah~\cite{AtiyahKR}, is a less generic example. Throughout, $\R^{p,q}$ denotes
the $C_2$-representation that's $p$ copies of the trivial representation and $q$ copies of the sign representation,
and $\C^n\cong\R^{n,n}$ has a $C_2$-action by complex conjugation.
\begin{defn}
Let $X$ be a $C_2$-space,\footnote{We require $X$ to be compact and Hausdorff, as in ordinary $K$-theory, but are
there any other assumptions?} with $\vp\colon X\to X$ the action of the nonzero element of $C_2$. A \term{real
equivariant vector bundle} is a complex vector bundle $\pi\colon E\to X$ together with a $C_2$-action
$\widetilde\vp\colon E\to E$ such that
\begin{itemize}
	\item $\pi$ is a $C_2$-map, and
	\item for each $x\in X$, the map $\widetilde\vp\colon E_x\to E_{\vp(x)}$ is antilinear.
\end{itemize}
\end{defn}
The Grothendieck group of real equivariant vector bundles on $X$ is denoted $\KR^0(X)$.
\begin{thm}[Real equivariant Bott periodicity]
There's a natural isomorphism $\beta\colon\KR^0(S^{1,1}\wedge X)\cong \KR^0(X)$.
\end{thm}
Using this, one can define $\KR^{p,q}(X) \coloneqq \KR^0(S^{p+n, q+n}\wedge X)$ for an $n > p,q$ as with ordinary
$K$-theory, and obtain an $\RO(C_2)$-graded cohomology theory. We want to lift this to a $C_2$-spectrum.
\begin{lem}
In $\widetilde I_{C_2}$, the complex linear inclusions $\C^n\inj\C^{n+1}$ are cofinal.\footnote{\TODO: I'm not sure
whether this is the right word, or whether this is why the construction works. The literature is terse as to why
you can do this. I'd also like to be more explicit about this.}
\end{lem}
Hence, to define a $C_2$-spectrum $E$, it suffices to define structure maps $S^{1,1}\wedge E(\C^n)\to E(\C^{n+1})$.

For $\KR$, let $\KR(\C^n) \coloneqq \Z\times B\U$, with $C_2$ acting by complex conjugation on $B\U$ and trivially
on $\Z$. Then, the structure map $S^{1,1}\wedge \KR(\C^n)\to\KR(\C^{n+1})$ is the map $\Z\times B\U\to\Z\times B\U$
which classifies Bott periodicity. Hence we obtain a $C_2$-spectrum $\KR$, called \term{real equivariant
$K$-theory}, and Bott periodicity tells us that $\Sigma^{1,1}\KR\simeq\KR$.
\end{exm}
We'll discuss another important example, equivariant Eilenberg-Mac Lane spectra, in \cref{EMcons}.

\subsection*{Functors on $\Spc^G$.}
Let $H\subset G$ be a subgroup, so restriction defines a functor $i_H\colon \Spc^G\to\Spc^H$. Just as for
$G$-spaces, $i_H$ has a left adjoint $G_+\wedge_H\bl$ and a right adjoint $F_H(G_+,\bl)$, and these are constructed
space-wise.
\begin{prop}
$G_+\wedge_H\bl$ and $F_H(G_+,\bl)$ are left (resp.\ right) Quillen functors.\index{Quillen adjunction}
\end{prop}
\begin{rem}
You might worry what universe you end up in after applying $i_H$ --- naïvely you get the $H$-representations that
arise from restriction of $G$-representations, but you might want all $H$-representations. The way to address this
is to use a change-of-universe functor, which we'll discuss in \S\ref{change_of_universe_sec}. This is a good thing
to not be sloppy about, but is annoying, and is why people try to get the universe out of the point-set category.
In any case, as in group cohomology, induction and coinduction are isomorphic through the \term*{Wirthmüller
isomorphism} (\cref{Wirthiso}).\index{group cohomology}\index{change-of-universe
map}\index{Wirthmüller isomorphism}
\end{rem}
One thing that's nice to do with $G$-spectra is take fixed points. There are \emph{three} different ways to do
this, namely homotopy fixed points, categorical fixed points, and geometric fixed points, and keeping them separate
in your head is important.

$\Spc^G$ is a \emph{closed} symmetric monoidal category, meaning it has internal function objects. This is true for
$\fD$-spaces in general, with internal function objects\index{symmetric monoidal category!closed}
\[F_\fD(X,Y)(n) \coloneqq F(X, Y(n)).\]
This is exactly like the mapping complex of two chain complexes: you're looking at chain maps from $X$ to shifts of
$Y$.

$\Spc^G$ is tensored and cotensored over $G$-spaces, meaning we can smash $G$-spectra with $G$-spaces, and take
function objects from $G$-spaces to $G$-spectra: if $A$ is a $G$-space, tensoring with $A$ is $A_+\wedge\bl$
applied levelwise, and cotensoring with $A$ is $F(A_+,\bl)$ applied levelwise.
\begin{defn}\hfill
\label{spectra_fixed_points}
\index{fixed points!of a $G$-spectrum}
\begin{itemize}
	\item The \term{homotopy fixed points} is the functor $X\mapsto F(EG_+, X)^G$. (Here, $EG_+$ is a $G$-space, so
	we're using the cotensor of $G$-spaces and $G$-spectra.)
	\item The \term{categorical fixed points} is the functor $(\bl)^H\colon X\mapsto F(G/H_+, X)$. As the notation
	suggests, this is analogous to $(\bl)^H$ on $G$-spaces.
\end{itemize}
\end{defn}
\begin{warn}
You might hope that $(\Sigma^\infty A_+)^H = \Sigma^\infty A_+^H$, so that fixed points of spaces lead to fixed
points of spectra, but this is \emph{not} true. It has a more complicated description called
\term{tom Dieck splitting} as a wedge of other pieces.
\end{warn}
\begin{defn}
The \term{geometric fixed points}, denoted $\Phi^H$ or also $X^{gH}$, is the unique functor
such that
\begin{enumerate}
	\item it's (derived) symmetric monoidal: if $X$ and $Y$ are cofibrant,
	$\Phi^H(X)\wedge\Phi^H(Y)\congto\Phi^H(X\wedge Y)$.
	\item $\Phi^H$ preserves homotopy colimits.
	\item $\Phi^H\Sigma^\infty X \cong \Sigma^\infty X^H$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{defn}
Of course, uniqueness (up to a contractible space of choices) is a theorem, but it's true. We'll also give a
preferred construction.

We'll prove that categorical and geometric fixed points detect weak equivalences.\index{weak equivalence}
\begin{comp}{thm}{enumerate}
	\item A map $X\to Y$ in $\Spc^G$ is a weak equivalence iff $X^H\to Y^H$ is a weak equivalence for all subgroups
	$H\subset G$.
	\item A map $X\to Y$ in $\Spc^G$ is a weak equivalence iff $\Phi^H X\to \Phi^H Y$ is a weak equivalence for all
	subgroups $H\subset G$.
\end{comp}

This leads one to consider diagrams on categorical or geometric fixed points: because of this perspective, one can
define Tate spectra using this philosophy, and this is particularly useful when applied to $S^1$-spectra. It was
originally developed by John Greenlees, and has recently been repopularized and is being mined for applications,
such as Nikolaus-Scholze's description of topological cyclic homology~\cite{NikolausScholze}.\index{Tate
spectrum}\index{topological cyclic homology}

We're going to try to understand the equivariant stable category from a few other perspectives: the Wirthmüller
isomorphism is an analogue of the isomorphism between finite products and coproducts in spectra, and we'll also
learn more about tom Dieck splitting. You can also ask how the transfer maps we talked about
characterize the equivariant stable category.\index{transfer map}
